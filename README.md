# Stuck in the Mud
## A game for five dice
- All players start with a score of zero.
- The first player rolls all five dice.
- Set aside any 2's or 5's that are rolled
- Add up the total of the remaining dice
- Add this roll's total to the player's current score
- Roll any remaining dice.

Continue in this way until all the dice are “Stuck in the Mud” (ie, all dice rolled come up as a 2 or a 5), at which point, play passes to the left.
